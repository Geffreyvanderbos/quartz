See the flowchart above how I get my content in my Obsidian Vault.\n\nI highlight everything that resonates with me (when I feel something or think of something while consuming). I don't filter. After, I gather all these highlights in my source notes in my `01 Inbox` folder. In the processing phase, I'll make more conscious decisions on what I make notes out of. More on that later.\n\nIn my source notes, I always include a reference to the original piece of media. It could be a link or any other identifier. See the source note template below.\n\nI use the plugin `Templater` to have more control over the templates. For example adding a 'created' date.\n\nMost of the time, I rely on [Readwise](https://readwise.io) to collect my highlights and place them in my vault under `01 Inbox/Readwise`. I enjoy consuming a thing as a whole, and after that, I scroll through the highlights to *process* them.\n\n```mermaid\n\ngraph TD\n\n  \n\nP[Podcast] --\u003e Snipd(Snipd) --\u003e Readwise\n\nSource[YouTube/Article/PDF] --\u003e Reader\n\nReader(Readwise Reader) --\u003e Readwise\n\nB[Book] --\u003e\n\nLeaf(KOReader on Leaf 2) --\u003e\n\nReadwise(Readwise) --\u003e D\n\nCourse(Course) --\u003e\n\nD[Source Note in 01 Inbox]\n\n  \n\n```\n\n\u003e [!info]- Source Note template\n\u003e\n\u003e \\-\\-\\-\n\u003e\n\u003e title: \u003c\\% tp.file.title \\%\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e author:\n\u003e\n\u003e publishdate:\n\u003e\n\u003e url:\n\u003e\n\u003e dateRead: \u003c\\% tp.date.now \\%\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e tag:\n\u003e\n\u003e type:\n\u003e\n\u003e \\-\\-\\-\n\u003e\n\u003e \\#\\# Outline\n\u003e\n\u003e \\#\\# Key Takeaways\n\n## Processing and Creating Atomic Notes\n\nIn this context, I define *processing* as the act of extracting value from highlights in the form of notes.\n\nIn my `01 Inbox` folder, I go through the source notes' highlights. Every idea that still resonates (even after reading it twice) gets written in an 'atomic' note. These notes are often less than 300 words, and I make sure they're focused on one idea alone.\n\nI use a template (`98 Templates/01 New Note`) to create them and tag them as 'new.' They end up in `01 Inbox` by default. (See Writing and Connecting Note on how I write the notes.)\n\n```mermaid\n\nflowchart TD\n\n  \n\nA(Highlights)\n\nA --\u003e B[Atomic Note]\n\nA --\u003e C[Atomic Note]\n\nA --\u003e D[Atomic Note..]\n\n  \n\n```\n\nOnce I've *processed* a whole source note, I move the source note from the `01 Inbox` to `03 Sources` (`Plugin: Commander - Move File ribbon icon`). Denoting that I've extracted all value from it.\n\n```mermaid\n\nflowchart LR\n\n  \n\nA(01 Inbox)\n\n--\u003e |Source Note|B(03 Sources)\n\n  \n\n```\n\n### Writing and Connecting Notes\n\nI force myself to write the atomic notes in my own words. No copy pasting allowed. That usually means simplifying the writing, adding some translations, and avoiding jargon. It really helps you to understand what is being communicated.\n\nEach atomic note has a *reference*, *related*, *new ideas*, and *new questions* section. (See the new note template below.) Under the reference section I refer to the source note in my vault.\n\nWhile writing a note, if I think of notes that **contradict, correct, or support** the idea, I make sure to link it. Either inline or under the _related_ section. It helps when you write a short description on how it is related.\n\n```mermaid\n\nflowchart TD\n\n  \n\nA[Idea A]\n\nB[Concept B]\n\nC[Concept C]\n\nD[Phenomenon D]\n\n  \n\nA --\u003e |contradicts|B\n\nC --\u003e |supports|D\n\nB --\u003e |corrects|D\n\n```\n\nI jot down any new ideas (üí°) or questions (üßê) that arise while writing the note. New ideas get written in another atomic note and linked (`Plugin: Note Refactor`).\n\nBecause I tag questions with `#question`, I can use `Plugin: Dataview` to list them all in one note.\n\n\u003e [!info]- List all \\#questions Dataview Query\n\u003e\n\u003e \\`\\`\\`dataview\n\u003e\n\u003e LIST\n\u003e\n\u003e L.text\n\u003e\n\u003e FROM \"02 Notes\"\n\u003e\n\u003e flatten file.lists as L\n\u003e\n\u003e where contains(L.tags, \"#question\")\n\u003e\n\u003e \\`\\`\\`\n\n\u003e [!info]- New note template\n\u003e\n\u003e \\-\\-\\-\n\u003e\n\u003e date: \u003c\\% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm\") \\%\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e title: \u003c\\% tp.file.title \\%\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e tags: new\n\u003e\n\u003e \\-\\-\\-\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003c\\% tp.file.cursor(1) \\%\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e ---\n\u003e\n\u003e **‚Ü©Ô∏è Reference**:\n\u003e\n\u003e **üñáÔ∏è Related (and how?)**: %% contradicts, corrects, supports %%\n\u003e\n\u003e **üí°New ideas**:\n\u003e\n\u003e **üßê New questions**:\n\n## Reviewing and Resurfacing Notes\n\nEvery day, I try to resurface at least one note using the `plugin: Simple Note Review`.\n\nAs I review the note, I ask myself how the information adds to my other notes. I ask the same questions as I did when creating the note. Does it contradict, correct, or support other notes? Do new ideas come to mind? Do any new questions arise?\n\n\u003e [!info] The Collector's Fallacy\n\u003e\n\u003e Remember, you're not just collecting information; you're developing your ideas and arguments. Notes shouldn't go 'stale'. It's that, that separates traditional note taking from personal knowledge management.\n\nAt this point, I consider the note no longer `new` and remove the tag, if it had it. Although I rather review 'new' notes, I also make sure I bring older notes in the mix.\n\nResurfacing notes at random really helps 'tend' to your personal knowledge management. There is something satisfying about being aware your perspective changed since you last wrote said note. Or that new information fills a gap in your knowledge you didn't know you had.\n\n\u003e [!info] Maps of Content\n\u003e\n\u003e If I find myself pulling in too many related notes on to one atomic note, I consider creating a Map of Content instead, organizing the related notes under specific topics and headings. You can also see these MoCs develop organically in your graph view.\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-27T13:41:11.396204345Z","tags":[]}}
