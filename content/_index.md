üëãüèª You've found my public notes. I take notes on everything that interests me. Some notes I share with the world. Read about my [[notes/My PKM Methodology|PKM methodology here]].

I'm Geffrey, a product manager with a design background and a passion for music. I believe in the power of collaboration and team dynamics to bring great ideas to life.

Currently, I'm devoting my weekends to [Vanaheim](https://getvanaheim.com), a software that helps independent musicians streamline their financial, release, tour, and equipment management processes.

In my role at Comecer Netherlands, I leverage my expertise to maintain legacy software while simultaneously developing a user-centric radiopharmacy workflow management platform.

Previously, I headed an exceptional team of engineers and data scientists at Kaios.ai, where we crafted AI models to revolutionize infrastructure inventory.

As a Product Designer at Bitfactory GmbH, I contributed to the creation of award-winning mobile apps and SaaS products.

While not seeking new opportunities, I enjoy connecting with like-minded professionals. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and Mastodon.
